## **üîß DEVELOPMENT RULES:**

1. **ONE FEATURE AT A TIME** - Build incrementally
2. **TEST EACH ADDITION** - See it working before adding more
3. **USE COLOR VARIABLES** - Never hardcode colors
4. **KEEP FILES SMALL** - Split into components when needed
5. **DOCUMENT CHANGES** - Update this README when structure changes
6. **‚ö†Ô∏è STRICT: NO SCALE TRANSFORMS** - NEVER use scale() on hover or click states
   - Creates jittery, unprofessional feeling
   - Use only translateY() for vertical movement
   - Shadow changes are sufficient for depth perception
   - This is a PERMANENT RULE - no exceptions
