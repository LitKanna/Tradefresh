# OBSOLETE CONFIGURATIONS

**Date:** 2025-01-20
**Reason:** Replaced with streamlined design-focused workflow system

## Obsolete Files (DO NOT USE)

### Old Agent System
- ❌ `automatic-parallel-execution.json` - Overcomplicated, replaced by `auto-spawn-design.json`
- ❌ `agent-triggers.json` - Replaced by workflow triggers
- ❌ `model-selection-rules.yaml` - Not needed for design focus
- ❌ `model-config.json` - Simplified in new system
- ❌ `PARALLEL_AGENT_SYSTEM.md` - Old documentation

### Old Agents (DEPRECATED)
- ❌ `agents/master-orchestrator.md` - Too complex, not needed
- ❌ `agents/test-architect.md` - Testing deferred for rapid development
- ❌ `agents/devops-infrastructure-orchestrator.md` - Not needed for design
- ❌ `agents/pragmatic-solutions-architect.md` - Overcomplicated
- ❌ `agents/reality-enforcement-agent.md` - Slows down development
- ❌ `agents/state-coordinator.md` - Not needed
- ❌ `agents/data-architect.md` - Not for UI design
- ❌ `agents/cost-optimizer.md` - Not priority

## Active Configurations (USE THESE)

### New Streamlined System
- ✅ `settings.json` - Main settings file
- ✅ `workflows/design-development-workflow.json` - Design workflow
- ✅ `agents/design-team.json` - Design-focused agents
- ✅ `auto-spawn-design.json` - Auto parallel spawning

### Kept Agents (STILL USEFUL)
- ✅ `agents/ui-architect.md` - UI design
- ✅ `agents/ux-flow-engineer.md` - UX design
- ✅ `agents/master-implementation-executor.md` - Implementation
- ✅ `agents/critical-systems-analyst.md` - Design review only

## How It Works Now

1. **Automatic Parallel Execution**: Any design-related keyword triggers parallel agent spawning
2. **Simplified Team**: Only 4 agent types focused on design
3. **No Waiting**: Agents work independently and in parallel
4. **Rapid Development**: Skip unnecessary analysis and validation
5. **Design Focus**: Everything optimized for UI/UX development

## Commands

- `/design` - Start parallel design workflow
- `/canvas` - Work on dashboard canvas
- `/build` - Build component in parallel
- `/style` - Apply styling
- `/implement` - Implement designs

## Benefits

- **3-6x faster** than old system
- **No agent conflicts** - streamlined roles
- **Immediate spawning** - no orchestration delays
- **Design-first** - optimized for UI work
- **Parallel by default** - always runs multiple agents
