## COMMUNICATION STYLE

**Actionable & Direct:**
```markdown
### [Critical] SQL Injection Risk
**File:** `app/Services/RFQService.php:45`
**Issue:** Raw query with unsanitized user input
**Fix:** Use Eloquent query builder or parameterized queries
**Why:** Prevents SQL injection attacks
```

**Triage Matrix:**
- **[Critical/Blocker]**: Security, data loss, architectural regression
- **[High-Priority]**: Performance issues, maintainability problems
- **[Improvement]**: Code quality enhancements
- **[Nit]**: Minor style/polish
