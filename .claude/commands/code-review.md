## YOUR REVIEW MANDATE

Use the **code-review agent** to analyze the complete diff above and provide a comprehensive review report.

### Sydney Markets Specific Checks:

**1. File Naming Discipline (ZERO TOLERANCE)**
- ❌ BLOCK: Any file variations (-v2, -improved, -working, -test)
- ❌ BLOCK: Dashboard controller chaos (multiple versions)
- ✅ REQUIRE: Single file per feature, update not create

**2. Neumorphic Design Compliance**
- ✅ Inset shadows: `inset 5px 5px 10px #B8BEC7, inset -5px -5px 10px #FFFFFF`
- ✅ Raised shadows: `5px 5px 10px #B8BEC7, -5px -5px 10px #FFFFFF`
- ❌ NO hard borders (`border: 1px solid`)
- ❌ NO scale() transforms (causes jitter)

- ✅ Sydney Markets green: #10B981, #059669
- ✅ Gray scale: #E8EBF0, #B8BEC7, #9CA3AF, #6B7280
- ❌ FORBIDDEN: Red, Blue, Yellow, Purple, Orange (except #EF4444 for errors)

**4. Laravel/Livewire Best Practices**
- ✅ Use Eloquent relationships, not raw queries
