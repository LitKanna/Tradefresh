## Test Steps

### Step 1: Open Buyer Dashboard

1. **Open browser** (Chrome/Firefox)
2. **Navigate to:** `http://localhost:8000/buyer/dashboard`
3. **Login as buyer:**
   - Email: `john.smith@gmail.com`
   - Password: `password`

### Step 2: Open Browser Console

1. **Press F12** to open DevTools

3. **Look for these messages:**
   ```
   âœ… Subscribed to buyers.all channel
   âœ… Subscribed to quotes.buyer.1 channel
   ðŸ“¡ Echo initialized and channels subscribed
   ```

**If you see these messages:** WebSocket connection is working! âœ“

**If you DON'T see these messages:** Reverb server is not running. Go back to Prerequisites.

### Step 3: Open Vendor Dashboard (New Browser Window)

2. **Navigate to:** `http://localhost:8000/vendor/dashboard`
3. **Login as vendor:**

2. **Click "View Details"** button
3. **Fill in quote details:**
   - Product: Select "Pears" (or any product)
   - Quantity: 10

4. **Click "Submit Quote"** button

### Step 5: Watch Buyer Dashboard (Real-Time Update)

**Switch back to buyer dashboard window.**

**What you should see (within 1 second):**

1. **Browser Console Messages:**

   ðŸ“¥ Quote received via buyers.all: QuoteReceived
   === QUOTE RECEIVED VIA PUBLIC CHANNEL ===
   Quote ID: 60

   - Green "Accept Quote" button is active

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No messages in browser console

**Solution:**
1. Check Reverb server is running: `netstat -ano | findstr :9090`
2. Restart Reverb server: Close terminal and run `start-reverb.bat` again
3. Refresh buyer dashboard (F5)

### Issue: Quote appears after manual refresh but NOT in real-time

**Solution:**
1. Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
2. Look for broadcasting errors
3. Ensure `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb` in `.env` file
4. Restart Reverb server

### Issue: 403 errors in console

**Solution:**
- This should NOT happen (we're using public channels)
- If it does, check `routes/channels.php` for channel authorization
- Ensure channels are public, not private

### Issue: Quote expired immediately

**Solution:**
- This is NORMAL for quotes older than 30 minutes
- Submit a NEW quote to test real-time functionality
- Old quotes are filtered out automatically

---

## Expected Results Summary

### Database Check (Run this anytime)
```php
php artisan tinker
Quote::orderBy('created_at', 'desc')->first();
```

You should see the most recent quote with:
- `buyer_id: 1`
- `status: 'submitted'`
- `created_at: [recent timestamp]`

### Real-Time Check (Watch browser console)
```
âœ… Subscribed to buyers.all channel
âœ… Subscribed to quotes.buyer.1 channel
ðŸ“¥ Quote received via buyers.all: QuoteReceived
=== QUOTE RECEIVED VIA PUBLIC CHANNEL ===
âœ… FRONTEND RE-RENDER EVENTS DISPATCHED
```

### Visual Check (Watch buyer dashboard)
- Quote card appears within 1 second
- Timer shows 30:00 and counts down
- Vendor name and product name are correct
- Amount matches submitted quote
- "Accept Quote" button is green and active
