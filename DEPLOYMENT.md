# Laravel Cloud Deployment Guide

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. PHP 8.2 Deprecation Warnings - FIXED ✅
- **ProcessAbandonedCarts.php:92** - Changed `${$cart->total_amount}` to `{$cart->total_amount}`
- **TestWebSocket.php:54,55,85** - Changed `${variable}` to `{variable}`

### 2. PHP Nullable Parameter Deprecations - FIXED ✅
- **VendorTrackingService.php:28** - Added `?` to nullable parameter: `?string $sessionId = null`
- **BulkHunterService.php:29** - Added `?` to nullable parameter: `?string $postcode = null`

### 3. Laravel Octane Process ID File Error - SOLUTION

**Problem:** Laravel Cloud tries to use Octane/FrankenPHP but can't write process ID files due to permissions.

**Solution:** Disable Octane for Laravel Cloud deployment

#### Steps to Fix:

1. **In Laravel Cloud Dashboard → Environment Variables**, add:
   ```
   OCTANE_SERVER=
   ```
   (Set it to empty/blank to disable Octane)

2. **Or** update your `.env` file on the server to include:
   ```
   OCTANE_SERVER=
   ```

3. **Alternative:** If you want to use Octane, configure writable storage:
   ```
   # This may not work on Laravel Cloud due to container restrictions
   # Best to disable Octane instead
   ```

## Files Created for Deployment

1. **`.env.cloud`** - Example cloud environment configuration
2. **`.cloud/deploy.sh`** - Deployment script (if Laravel Cloud supports it)
3. **`laravel-cloud.yaml`** - Laravel Cloud configuration

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Set `OCTANE_SERVER=` (empty) in Laravel Cloud dashboard
- [ ] Verify database credentials are set in Cloud dashboard
- [ ] Set `APP_ENV=production` and `APP_DEBUG=false`
- [ ] Configure mail driver (SMTP or log)
- [ ] Set `APP_URL` to your Laravel Cloud URL

## Why Disable Octane for Cloud?

Laravel Cloud manages scaling and performance automatically. Octane is designed for self-managed servers where you need high performance. For cloud deployments:

- ✅ Laravel Cloud handles scaling
- ✅ FPM is more stable for containerized environments
- ✅ Avoids permission issues with process ID files
- ✅ Simpler deployment with fewer moving parts

You can always enable Octane later if needed, but standard FPM should work perfectly for most B2B applications.

## Next Deployment Attempt

After setting `OCTANE_SERVER=` in Laravel Cloud environment variables, try deploying again. The app should start successfully with FPM instead of crashing with Octane.
